# Hooks Folder

This folder contains **custom React hooks** for reusable state and logic.

## Examples

- `useAuth()` → manages authentication state
- `useFetchData(apiUrl)` → reusable API fetching
- `useDebounce(value, delay)` → debounce inputs

## Guidelines

- Hooks must be reusable across features.
- Name all hooks with the `use` prefix.
- Keep them small and focused on a single task.
