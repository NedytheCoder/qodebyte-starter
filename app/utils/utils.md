# Utils Folder

This folder contains helper functions and utilities used across the project.

## Examples

- `formatDate.js` → format dates consistently
- `currencyFormatter.js` → format numbers into currency
- `validateEmail.js` → email validation

## Guidelines

- Keep utils pure and reusable.
- No UI logic here — only logic that can be shared across features.
- If multiple features use the same helper, move it here.
