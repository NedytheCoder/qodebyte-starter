# Pages Folder

This folder contains top-level **route pages** for the app.

## Examples

- `Login.jsx` → `/login`
- `Dashboard.jsx` → `/dashboard`
- `Expenses.jsx` → `/expenses`

## Guidelines

- Pages combine features and components to build full screens.
- Routing should map directly to files here.
- Keep logic inside features/services, not directly in pages.
