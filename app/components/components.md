# Components Folder

This folder contains **reusable UI components** that can be used across multiple features and pages.

## Examples

- Buttons
- Modals
- Form inputs
- Tables
- Loaders

## Guidelines

- Components here should be **generic** and customizable via props.
- Do not include feature-specific logic (those go inside `/features`).
- Use TailwindCSS for styling.
